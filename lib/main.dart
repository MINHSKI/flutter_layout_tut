// Considerations:
// The first step is to break the layout down to its basic elements:
//
// Identify the rows and columns.
// Does the layout include a grid?
// Are there overlapping elements?
// Does the UI need tabs?
// Notice areas that require alignment, padding, or borders.
// First, identify the larger elements. In this example, four elements are
// arranged into a column: an image, two rows, and a block of text.
//
// Next, diagram each row. The first row, called the Title section, has 3
// children: a column of text, a star icon, and a number. Its first child,
// the column, contains 2 lines of text. That first column takes a lot of space,
// so it must be wrapped in an Expanded widget.
//
// The second row, called the Button section, also has 3 children: each child
// is a column that contains an icon and text.
//
// Once the layout has been diagrammed, itâ€™s easiest to take a bottom-up approach
// to implementing it. To minimize the visual confusion of deeply nested layout
// code, place some of the implementation in variables and functions.
